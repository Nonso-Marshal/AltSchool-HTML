        <p>My name is Chukwunonso Anawana also known as <strong>Marshal</strong>, 
        I am a graduate of Geophysics from Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka. 
        I am very passionate about the act of creating solutions through programming
        which is what prompted me to embark on this journey with the hope to become
        a solution provider in the area of Geosciences as it relates to Software development.<p>

        My interest in software development was sparked in 2022 when I attended a webinar titled <strong>"Future of Work"</strong>, which highlighted where significant advancements in technology would occur during the next phase of human progress. Following the webinar, I became eager to become an influential figure in this field and started exploring ways to turn this new dream into reality. However, I faced disappointment due to the high costs associated with acquiring the necessary skills and the challenging nature of the courses. Despite these setbacks, I remained committed to my goal of becoming a software engineer. My hope was renewed when a friend introduced me to Altschool in late 2023; they were then a student of Product Design. Unfortunately, by the time I learned about Altschool, admissions for that year had already closed. Before enrolling in 2024, I conducted some research and discovered that Altschool offers a beginner-friendly curriculum and has impressive instructorsâ€”some of whom I've heard about beyond their association with Altschool.

    <p>Opting for backend programming with Python was a straightforward decision for me, as I already had some familiarity with the language from completing the free course, <strong>Introduction to Python Programming by David J. Malan</strong> at Harvard University. Although the course was designed for beginners, I aimed to expand on my knowledge and progress from a novice to a more skilled programmer. </p>
