WEBVTT

00:41.542 --> 00:44.216
Come on!
Get the lead out!

00:47.297 --> 00:49.470
Run the fuckers over!

01:02.521 --> 01:04.023
Come on, Jamie!

01:06.316 --> 01:09.195
Come on, get up.
Get up!

01:32.718 --> 01:35.312
This plane is for members of
the provisional government only.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.599
Which of
your men do I kill to make room for mine?

01:41.351 --> 01:42.853
Get in! Get in!

01:45.606 --> 01:46.698
Pull.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.363
Straight ahead.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.869
Everybody look straight ahead.
Straight ahead

01:56.742 --> 01:58.619
Stop him!

02:07.336 --> 02:08.838
This man's dead.
Get him out!

02:18.263 --> 02:20.061
He's alive, you pimp!

02:24.728 --> 02:27.481
Everybody who
comes with me goes home.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.158
Let's go.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.573
Hey! Let's see
this thing fly.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.659
What name have you
given to your child?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.709
Richard Patrick Miller.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.089
And what do you ask of
God's church for your child?

03:26.415 --> 03:27.632
Baptism.

03:30.919 --> 03:36.301
If your faith makes you ready
to accept this responsibility,

03:38.135 --> 03:42.060
renew now the vows
of your own baptism.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.392
Reject sin.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.321
Profess faith
in Jesus Christ.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.196
- This is the faith of the Church.
- Don't touch.

03:58.113 --> 04:03.040
This is the faith
in which this child is about to be baptized.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.421
Do you
reject Satan?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.089
- I do.
- I do.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.717
And all his works?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.339
- I do.
- Yes, I do.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.346
And all his
empty promises?

04:15.464 --> 04:16.807
- I do.
- I do.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.742
Let me hear from you.
I want to know how the kid's doing.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.619
Where he goes to school.
All that.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.205
When Richard deserted
in Vietnam,

04:44.242 --> 04:45.744
I wish you'd
had him arrested

04:45.827 --> 04:48.671
instead of bringing him back
and covering for him.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.548
He was yours after that.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.093
He wanted you to be
the baby's godfather, so you are.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.176
Don't come around
anymore, please.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.016
Come on, Jamie.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.317
No mail.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.453
What is this,
Watergate again or something?

05:24.533 --> 05:27.002
Oh, don't give me that
Watergate stuff! Look at you, look at you...

05:27.077 --> 05:29.921
What's the matter with me? I was
good enough for you when you married me.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.207
I can't stand
looking at you.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.797
Oh, no wonder.
I haven't got any money...

05:33.875 --> 05:36.219
I'm working 14 hours
a day and you ain't got any money?

06:41.443 --> 06:42.990
Their dogs get too fat.

06:43.069 --> 06:47.620
Now, we also heard of a woman in Los
Angeles who will write a song for your dog.

06:47.657 --> 06:52.163
You send her a picture of your pet along
with the biography and $75,

06:52.245 --> 06:55.670
and she'll send you
a cassette, a musical portrait of your pooch.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.221
You got any money?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.011
What's it to you?

07:27.364 --> 07:30.243
You can always be a beggar
when you grow up.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.028
Yeah.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.164
Endean?

08:11.992 --> 08:12.993
No, I don't know him.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.350
How did you get up here?

09:14.429 --> 09:15.806
Yes.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.569
The corporate interests
I represent

09:25.648 --> 09:28.993
contemplate investing
several hundred million dollars

09:29.778 --> 09:34.659
in the development
of certain resources in Zangaro.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.993
Where?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.498
West Africa.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.707
Do you read the papers,
Mr. Shannon?

09:41.998 --> 09:45.593
The President, Olu Kimba,
is frequently on the front page.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.129
Yeah. Go on.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.925
Before money is
invested in Zangaro,

09:52.175 --> 09:56.396
we have to know a lot more
about the stability of Kimba's regime.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.647
Is a coup d'état imminent?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.232
Or even possible?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.197
We have to know.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.526
You ought to be able
to get that information through an embassy.

10:09.567 --> 10:14.619
Who the hell do you think has diplomatic
relations with a maniac like Kimba?

10:14.697 --> 10:15.869
I don't know.

10:15.907 --> 10:19.252
Mr. Shannon,
the world's running short of commodities.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.671
One day,
we'll go to war over rice.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.129
The job pays $10,000.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.386
Fifteen.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.389
Half tomorrow,
the rest when I get back.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.885
It's only a reconnaissance.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.387
- Did you steal this?
- No.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.305
- You sure?
- I don't steal.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.232
You got 35 to 100.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.560
- That's good.
- What do you know about bird-watching?

10:43.601 --> 10:46.445
Ornithology.
You don't stand right under them.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.114
- How long you'll be gone?
- In and out in a week.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.987
Watch yourself, Jamie.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.034
- Red on red?
- Red on red. Pull it out.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.662
I'm not back in a month to two
years you and Drew come get me.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.831
You bet.
He was in here last week.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.750
He wanted me to go bear-hunting with him
in Canada with a bow and arrow.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.203
- Smart.
- Smart.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.791
Seemed like
a damn messy way to be killed to me.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.589
- He go?
- I don't know.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.668
He told me about the baptism.
I think that's damn fine.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.253
You should be
hell of a godfather.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.804
I'll see you.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.277
You got a godfather?

11:54.130 --> 11:58.055
Going in with such a conspicuous
cover I think is unnecessarily risky.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.727
I need a reason
to be there with a camera.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.224
Go as a tourist.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.265
Don't worry about it.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.360
What the hell's
a tourist going to be doing in Zangaro?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.153
- I've no idea.
- Right.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.779
But a reconnaissance is no
good if you don't come back.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.158
I always come back.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.634
Please sit up and fasten your seat belt.
Thank you.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.064
Brown?

13:31.019 --> 13:32.521
Keith Brown. Yes.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.279
What business do
you have in Zangaro?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.194
I work for a nature magazine.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.704
I take pictures
of birds and so on.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.536
Pictures of birds?

13:44.907 --> 13:45.908
Yes.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.789
In there.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.548
Attention, please.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.930
Here is an important
announcement.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.766
Visitors to Zangaro are warned

14:02.967 --> 14:06.096
that there is a curfew
in the city of Clarence

14:06.346 --> 14:08.940
between 6:00 p.m.
and 6:00 a.m.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.937
Do you have
a drinking problem, Mr. Brown?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.819
I thought there might be
a problem with the water.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.275
There is.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.300
Your pockets, please.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.558
Spanish. French.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.238
This is
Military Order No. 602.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.330
Long live President Kimba.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.889
Airport tax.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.561
What's that for, sport?

15:33.808 --> 15:35.481
Importation tax.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.618
Welcome to Zangaro.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.635
Can I give you a lift
into town, my son?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.888
Yes. Thank you.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.528
Is this your
first trip to Zangaro?

17:04.607 --> 17:05.950
Yes.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.454
Welcome to Clarence.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.847
- Thanks again.
- Goodbye. God bless.

17:51.237 --> 17:56.243
Hello. My name is Brown, Keith Brown.
I cabled you about a room.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.001
Brown.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.835
Brown.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.350
We've received no cable,
Mr. Brown.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.764
I sent it last week.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.691
The telegraph system
is somewhat irregular.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.731
How long do you wish
to stay with us?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.484
Four or five days.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.030
You got something quiet,
maybe in the back?

18:30.109 --> 18:33.204
Foreigners are restricted
to the second floor.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.834
Whatever you've got,
with its own shower if you can.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.710
Your passport, please.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.037
Do you need that?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.919
It will be returned
to you when you leave.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.804
You will have room 12.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.824
Mr. Brown,
your jeep is outside.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.163
Great.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.383
Hey, Bwana.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.488
Hey, Bwana. Hey, Bwana.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.859
In my jungle,
you'd be just another asshole-.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.206
Keep turning
on the boy.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.753
Keep shooting.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.546
Listen, we've got
permission.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.886
Watch the Jeep!

24:26.799 --> 24:29.143
Take it easy.
Everything's all right.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.220
This way.
Ken, keep it on the boy.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.071
Oh, good evening, Mr. Brown.
Did you get many pictures?

24:41.105 --> 24:43.403
Look, that guy you sent
me this morning isn't going to work out.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.608
I didn't send him.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.946
All right,
all right.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.076
We can't make
a film about your bloody country

24:50.114 --> 24:53.584
from the hotel lobby, can we?
For Christ's sake.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.422
Thank you
very kindly.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.422
Lousy bastards!

25:04.253 --> 25:06.051
Jeez, that kid, eh?

25:06.088 --> 25:07.214
Zangaro.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.099
Bastards.
Bastards!

25:09.133 --> 25:10.510
Leave it,
for Christ's sake.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.594
We'll be out of here
by the end of the week.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.806
How about a beer?
Beer, Alan?

25:16.557 --> 25:18.309
Bollocks!

25:24.982 --> 25:26.279
Having some trouble,
Mr. North?

25:26.316 --> 25:29.115
No, just a fundamental difference about the
value of human life, Mr. Dexter.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.281
Nothing that need
concern you.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.120
Oh! Stupid question,
but any messages for me?

25:34.199 --> 25:35.451
The wireless
is still out.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.369
Is it expected in soon?

25:37.453 --> 25:40.047
Mr. North, this is
Mr. Keith Brown, an American.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.093
That shouldn't
be too much of a language barrier.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.796
Shall we give it a try?

25:46.837 --> 25:48.259
- A beer?
- Sure.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.697
What about the Russians?

26:12.780 --> 26:16.375
There were a couple of mining
engineers in here a few months ago

26:16.450 --> 26:18.452
doing some kind of survey.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.997
The Russians must
have got on to it and sent these two down.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.879
They haven't been able
to get a government permit.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.834
Poor bastards are
losing their minds.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.017
Put on your party smile.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.485
Good evening.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.869
President Kimba.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.955
President.

27:00.035 --> 27:04.211
Mr. Keith Brown,
American naturalist.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.963
How're you doing?

27:07.626 --> 27:11.096
President Kimba
shares your interest in our wildlife.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.058
Especially our
native birds.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.476
Drink.

27:18.679 --> 27:19.771
Sure.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.149
Very kind.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.729
Here's to you.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.282
Due to his many
responsibilities,

27:30.607 --> 27:33.156
President Kimba
doesn't have the time

27:33.527 --> 27:37.282
to research the
scientific names of some of our rare species.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.116
Busy, busy, busy.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.080
Drink.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.329
No, one for my father.

27:44.705 --> 27:45.957
SO kind.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.879
It would please
the President enormously

27:52.546 --> 27:55.174
if you could give him
a scientific name

27:55.924 --> 27:57.517
for the great
crested grebe.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.685
Yeah?

28:02.097 --> 28:03.940
Maybe some other time.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.115
Just for you.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.239
Podiceps cristatus.

28:15.736 --> 28:16.737
Right?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.037
And the storm petrel?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.623
Hydrobates.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.041
There's more.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.463
Pelagicus.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.548
Right?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.632
And what about
the Bubbling Cisticola,

28:33.378 --> 28:35.676
the Esmeralda troglodytes,

28:35.756 --> 28:39.135
and there's my
absolute favorite and yours,

28:41.303 --> 28:43.271
Nectarine famosa.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.978
Here's to 'em.
God bless 'em.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.316
Drink.

28:53.148 --> 28:57.824
Public drunkenness
is a crime in Zangaro.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.540
Who's that guy?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.707
Woody Woodpecker?

29:15.837 --> 29:18.181
Good evening,
Miss Dexter.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.260
Mr. Brown?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.353
I'm Gabrielle Dexter.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.561
My father suggested
I show you around Clarence tomorrow.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.021
Sounds good.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.278
Meet me in the lobby at 8:00.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.528
That's the only
sight worth seeing in this bloody town.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.945
It's friendly, too.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.451
I wouldn't know.
It doesn't talk to me.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.163
One for the road?

29:46.201 --> 29:48.624
No, thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:06.221 --> 30:10.476
Around here, even the birds know
better than to be out at night.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.985
What do you know
about birds?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.658
Well, I'm no expert either.

30:27.409 --> 30:31.585
What did you and the guys do to get
in all that trouble today?

30:41.590 --> 30:46.061
A bunch of soldiers
were hauling off a young kid.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.223
He was scared
out of his wits.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.983
Finally, he managed
to pull himself free.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.947
And then one of the bastards
drove a bayonet through his throat.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.280
And we were right there
with the camera. We got it.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.113
Then they ripped the film
out of the camera and herded us back here.

31:04.154 --> 31:07.408
I'm surprised this Kimba lets
you and your people in here.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.418
I'll be more surprised
if he lets us out.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.204
How did he
get the job?

31:12.287 --> 31:15.336
Well, after they won
independence,

31:16.541 --> 31:19.795
there were three candidates
for the presidency,

31:19.836 --> 31:22.134
General Kimba,

31:22.172 --> 31:23.469
a Colonel Bobi,

31:23.507 --> 31:27.011
and a physician,
a moderate called Dr. Okoye.

31:27.094 --> 31:30.815
Now, Okoye wanted
to maintain links with the mother country,

31:31.431 --> 31:33.650
while our two gallant
freedom fighters

31:33.725 --> 31:37.320
ranted about nee-colonialism,
etcetera, etcetera.

31:38.772 --> 31:42.151
Kimba got elected.
Don't ask me why he won over Bobi.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.747
From what I've heard,
nothing to choose between them.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.576
A week after
Kimba took office,

31:51.326 --> 31:54.079
he forced Bobi
into exile and threw Dr. Okoye in prison.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.789
Any opposition left?

31:55.831 --> 31:58.050
You don't oppose Kimba.
That's treason.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.678
For that he has
your entire family murdered.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.508
Nobody really knows
what's going on here.

32:06.216 --> 32:09.516
Do you think one of his neighbors will come
in here and kick him out?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.976
He's no threat
to any other country.

32:12.013 --> 32:15.859
He's content to stay
within his borders and slaughter his own.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.195
I mean slaughter.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.190
Can't you smell it?

32:21.857 --> 32:23.200
Trouble is,

32:24.359 --> 32:27.579
there's so much of it
everywhere else in the world,

32:29.364 --> 32:32.083
nobody wants to know.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.798
You're a quiet one.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.093
Bird watching's
a quiet business.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.887
How would you know?

32:45.213 --> 32:47.056
Hey, you're not CIA, are you?

32:49.009 --> 32:51.011
Well, you're hardly KGB.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.140
Thanks for the drink.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.772
You are, are you?
You're fucking CIA.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.608
This is President Kimba's
official residence.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.978
It belonged to
the British governor in colonial times.

33:41.144 --> 33:44.239
If you live in a place like that,
I bet you stay home a lot.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.900
No, the President
no longer lives here.

33:48.652 --> 33:51.280
God spoke
to him in a dream.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.328
He told him he should
live among his warriors.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.626
Where's that?
In the jungle?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.337
He lives at
the garrison.

34:01.206 --> 34:06.133
In 1937, the colonial
government erected new ministerial offices.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.174
It was the first
electricity in Zangaro.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.723
A year later,
the Grand Pavilion was built.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.429
At the spring
assemblies,

34:16.471 --> 34:20.021
as many as a thousand people
would be dancing inside.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.398
The chandeliers
were shipped from Europe.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.195
You got a passport?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.113
Why do you ask?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.491
I can't believe
you'd stay here.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.282
This is not America,
Mr. Brown.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.501
What I do is never
governed by choice,

34:38.868 --> 34:40.666
only by circumstance.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.172
That's not true.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.719
Is Kimba Christian?

34:48.378 --> 34:50.380
He's head
of our church.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.343
I saw a couple of
nuns and a priest when I got here.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.099
How do they feel
about that?

34:56.177 --> 34:59.647
They went away,
but they're coming back now.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.317
There were
some difficulties.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.351
I'll bet.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.652
But now that President Kimba's
name is included in the Lord's Prayer,

35:07.689 --> 35:09.817
there are no more problems.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.168
Is that where he lives?

35:29.377 --> 35:33.052
Details regarding the garrison
are not available to anyone.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.361
Stand there.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.192
Say cheese.
For the scrapbook.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.902
The scrapbook?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.652
It's where you keep
your memories.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.824
And what's in yours?

35:56.404 --> 35:57.872
Not too much.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.868
Mr. Brown, what are
you really doing here?

36:00.909 --> 36:03.162
I told you,
I'm studying birds.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.668
Birds are smart.
They migrate,

36:06.748 --> 36:09.797
they know when things
are going to change and they fly away.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.672
Why don't we have dinner?

36:15.674 --> 36:18.097
I'm late, excuse me.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.513
Whoa! Wait a minute!

38:28.431 --> 38:30.229
Mr. Brown.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.695
Mr. Brown,
can you hear me?

38:38.399 --> 38:39.525
Okay.

38:40.276 --> 38:44.201
Mr. Brown, what are you
doing in Clarence?

38:46.533 --> 38:48.160
Water.

38:50.495 --> 38:54.966
Just tell me, what are you
doing in Clarence?

38:56.167 --> 38:57.339
Water.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.727
You are a naturalist,
are you not?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.360
Right.

39:25.905 --> 39:29.330
Why did you
take this picture of the garrison?

39:30.368 --> 39:31.870
She's pretty-

39:34.539 --> 39:36.086
Isn't she?

39:52.974 --> 39:55.898
Mr. Brown,
I am a doctor.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.903
I was told to clean
your wounds.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.824
You are being deported.
Released.

40:06.779 --> 40:07.826
Why?

40:08.489 --> 40:12.039
One of the guards said
an Englishman has been here all day

40:13.161 --> 40:16.335
trying to talk with you,
to interview you.

40:20.126 --> 40:25.007
He also filed
a formal protest with the Swiss consul.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.185
You have a friend,
Mr. Brown.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.360
You a prisoner?

40:43.524 --> 40:45.117
Over four years.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.867
What'd you do?

40:48.488 --> 40:50.035
Bad judgment.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.623
I was a candidate
for president.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.583
Dr. Okoye.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.337
How would you
know that?

41:03.378 --> 41:07.975
The Englishman,
my friend.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.312
How long
have I been here?

41:18.226 --> 41:19.819
Since yesterday.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.819
Why did they do this?

41:24.148 --> 41:26.867
Possibly for being
in the wrong company.

41:27.777 --> 41:30.826
The guard said you were
with Gabrielle Dexter.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.747
She's one of
Kimba's mistresses.

41:44.252 --> 41:47.256
She... She... It was her?

41:47.296 --> 41:48.764
No.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.677
She's beautiful.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.768
Not treacherous.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.437
Beauty is a currency.

41:59.726 --> 42:03.822
Unfortunately, here in Zangaro, it only has
value in the presidential palace.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.121
Have some of
these painkillers.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.958
They'll help you.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.379
Okoye.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.448
Mr. Brown, can you
tell us why you were arrested?

43:36.531 --> 43:39.205
What were
conditions like inside the prison?

43:39.826 --> 43:41.999
Were you able to see
any other prisoners?

43:42.912 --> 43:45.040
Mr. Brown?

43:45.123 --> 43:49.424
They say Dr. Okoye
is, in fact, dead. Can you confirm that?

43:51.045 --> 43:52.547
Mr. Brown.

43:55.550 --> 43:59.600
You can't leave Zangaro
without your passport, asshole.

44:56.277 --> 44:58.325
There're no fractures,

44:58.404 --> 44:59.826
but I don't understand why the hell

44:59.947 --> 45:02.746
you didn't see the doctor
when you were in Paris.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.456
Still got blood
in the urine?

45:04.493 --> 45:05.619
Yeah.

45:07.955 --> 45:12.756
Four, five, six. Six healthy
concussions in the last three years.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.259
Two crushed discs,

45:15.630 --> 45:19.100
two temporal fractures,
one major pneumothorax,

45:19.967 --> 45:21.685
perforated stomach,

45:22.470 --> 45:24.973
a hundred bouts
with unheard-of tropical diseases,

45:25.056 --> 45:27.684
a shitload of arm
and leg fractures,

45:27.767 --> 45:31.271
dyscrasia, dysentery,
dyspepsia,

45:31.312 --> 45:33.986
dysuria, dysphoria.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.946
Anything starting with 'D'
I didn't get?

45:35.983 --> 45:37.656
Yeah,

45:37.735 --> 45:39.078
dead.

45:39.153 --> 45:42.327
Henry, you gotta get
some new jokes.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.969
Look, I don't know
what you've got planned for your old age,

45:59.006 --> 46:01.350
or who you figure on
spending it with,

46:01.425 --> 46:02.893
but I suggest
you get at it.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.349
You've taken a lot of years
off the back end of your life.

46:13.646 --> 46:14.647
Thanks.

46:24.365 --> 46:26.413
Why the hell didn't
you call me as soon as you got back?

46:26.492 --> 46:28.711
I was busy.
You got the money?

46:28.869 --> 46:31.213
No, no, don't take
your coat off.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.003
There, that's for you.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.630
What does it mean?

46:40.256 --> 46:41.758
Can Kimba be replaced?

46:41.841 --> 46:43.093
Read the report.

46:43.175 --> 46:45.223
Is there any chance
of a coup?

46:45.261 --> 46:46.888
No, not now.

46:48.014 --> 46:51.609
He don't trust his own army.
Rations the bullets.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.063
He's crazy, see?

46:55.146 --> 46:57.399
So unless there's some kind
of guerilla army building up

46:57.481 --> 46:59.950
outside Zangaro
I don't know about,

47:00.234 --> 47:01.577
forget it!

47:04.613 --> 47:08.243
The people I represent
won't do business with a madman.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.754
He's obviously got to go.

47:20.379 --> 47:21.596
What did you say?

47:21.630 --> 47:25.351
Could a well-trained,
well-equipped mercenary force succeed?

47:25.968 --> 47:27.811
Succeed?
At what?

47:27.887 --> 47:29.434
Replacing Kimba.

47:29.764 --> 47:32.108
What'd you find over there?
Oil, diamonds?

47:32.183 --> 47:33.776
Could it succeed?

47:33.809 --> 47:35.436
Sure, why not?

47:38.773 --> 47:41.743
How long would it take you
to get an operation like that off the ground?

47:41.776 --> 47:44.495
Not me!
You bought a recon and you got it.

47:44.570 --> 47:47.414
I'm paid. I'm done.
Come on, let's go.

47:47.448 --> 47:49.291
You're paid, Shannon,

47:49.992 --> 47:51.790
but you're not finished.

47:51.827 --> 47:56.128
What would you want to go back
and get what they took from you?

47:57.291 --> 48:01.262
Would $100,000
cure cold feet?

48:02.088 --> 48:05.308
You've got me mixed up
with somebody else. Come on!

48:18.104 --> 48:20.232
Hello. Operator.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.408
I'd like to make
a person-to-person.

48:22.483 --> 48:23.905
OPERATOR". Name, please.

48:23.984 --> 48:25.986
Jessie Shannon.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.247
OPERATOR". Jessie Shannon.
Area code, please.

48:28.322 --> 48:31.622
- Area code 3-0-1.
3-0-1.

48:31.659 --> 48:36.631
JAMIE; 4-4-6-1-8-0-8.

48:37.206 --> 48:38.958
OPERATOR". Who shall
I say is calling?

48:38.999 --> 48:40.876
Just say Jessie.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.304
OPERATOR". Will you hold on,
please?

48:43.379 --> 48:47.509
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me to hold on. You hold on.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.779
Hello?

49:09.280 --> 49:10.281
Hello?

49:10.364 --> 49:11.866
Hello?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.201
Hello?

50:26.607 --> 50:27.733
Your move.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.411
WARNER'. God damn It!

50:30.444 --> 50:33.698
I'll get it, Dad.
Sit down. Sit down.

50:34.198 --> 50:37.077
Hard to keep my bluffer's
composure with the damn phone ringing.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.790
Saved by the bell.

50:38.827 --> 50:39.828
It's up to you.

50:39.912 --> 50:41.789
Jessie, it's me.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.420
Jamie?

50:53.259 --> 50:54.260
Where are you?

50:54.593 --> 50:57.142
The Bayview Motel, Hotel.

50:59.265 --> 51:01.939
It's a couple of blocks
from where the Starlight was.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.979
The Starlight
burned down.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.819
Yeah, I know.
That was two years ago.

51:07.856 --> 51:08.857
Three fours.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.198
Beat that.

51:12.278 --> 51:15.327
Jamie, you okay?

51:15.406 --> 51:17.124
Sure.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.659
What are you doing here?

51:21.495 --> 51:22.997
I want to see you.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.665
But...

51:25.374 --> 51:29.345
Could you come down here?
I don't want to run into your father.

51:30.504 --> 51:31.972
JESSE'. Give me half an hour.

51:33.257 --> 51:34.554
A pair of jacks.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.510
Oh, three jacks.
Pair of nines.

51:37.845 --> 51:39.097
Jessie?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.523
Everything okay?

51:41.557 --> 51:42.900
Yeah, sure.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.315
Daddy, I'm going out
for a while.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.354
Could you get us
some more ice first?

51:48.188 --> 51:49.405
Yeah, sure.

51:52.192 --> 51:53.409
I'm out.

52:02.995 --> 52:05.839
I'll stop playing poker
when Carlos is off.

52:06.081 --> 52:07.378
You shouldn't be
doing this.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.635
Don't be silly.
Go in and play your hand.

52:10.377 --> 52:11.720
Who called?

52:12.546 --> 52:13.923
Jamie.

52:14.006 --> 52:15.098
What did he want?

52:15.174 --> 52:16.721
I don't know.
He wanted to see me.

52:16.800 --> 52:17.892
Do you think
that's wise?

52:17.968 --> 52:21.347
We were married, for Christ's sake!
He wants to see me, I want to see him.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.392
He's the same, Jessie.
I know it. He hasn't changed.

52:24.433 --> 52:27.482
He's the same
irresponsible bastard you divorced.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.529
I didn't divorce him, you did!

53:04.098 --> 53:05.600
Did I scare you?

53:10.020 --> 53:11.397
It's cold.

53:14.108 --> 53:15.405
Is that you?

53:15.442 --> 53:16.568
Yeah.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.785
You got skinny.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.709
- You got on dark glasses.
- Yeah.

53:23.992 --> 53:25.289
How come?

53:25.619 --> 53:28.372
Well, I didn't want you
to see that...

53:28.914 --> 53:30.712
- You were crying?
- Yeah.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.424
They do a great job.

53:54.982 --> 53:58.236
What do you want to do?
You got time?

53:58.318 --> 53:59.695
Yeah, sure.

54:01.488 --> 54:02.831
Let's eat.

54:07.703 --> 54:10.707
I love you, Jessie.
That's what I'm here about.

54:11.415 --> 54:14.510
I want to move.
West.

54:16.044 --> 54:18.138
Colorado,
maybe Montana.

54:18.589 --> 54:22.844
I've never been there
but it's clean, it's open.

54:24.636 --> 54:29.233
I want to get a regular job.
Buy a house. All that.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.524
What do you say?

54:33.812 --> 54:36.531
It's all the stuff
we used to talk about.

54:37.399 --> 54:40.778
I've got the money
to get us started.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.157
When were you
thinking about going?

54:45.199 --> 54:46.371
Soon.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.624
I want to go right now.

54:51.830 --> 54:53.707
I want to go yesterday.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.212
You haven't changed.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.384
No.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.510
Still the
considerate planner.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.019
What do you say?

55:07.554 --> 55:10.057
Why don't we keep it
simple tonight?

55:15.562 --> 55:18.315
The way the tax situation
is out there,

55:19.525 --> 55:21.198
the land costs you
practically nothing.

55:21.235 --> 55:23.738
You put a house on it
and stay there.

55:23.779 --> 55:26.407
This guy tells me
you can put a trailer on the land.

55:26.448 --> 55:29.247
The government doesn't
know the difference. They don't care.

55:29.284 --> 55:30.752
You mad or what?

55:31.411 --> 55:32.754
You haven't asked
about my father.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.503
Yes, I did.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.208
I asked you to
go away with me.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.002
If you'd said yes,
I'd know he was dead.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.382
It wasn't his fault.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.171
- Was it mine?
- Yeah.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.757
As much as anybody's.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.513
Oh, please.
I didn't move out.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.889
You didn't try very hard
to stop me from going, did you?

55:46.927 --> 55:48.645
Don't tell me that.
I didn't move out! You did.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.269
It's what you do, Jamie.
You fight wars.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.771
Not your wars, not our wars.
Anybody's wars.

55:53.809 --> 55:56.904
You get paid to kill people,
get your ass blown off.

55:56.937 --> 56:00.111
You would be great
in Colorado, out west.

56:00.148 --> 56:02.571
You could be a hired gun,
play cowboy.

56:02.609 --> 56:04.828
We're talking about
your father.

56:04.903 --> 56:07.156
He didn't want you
married to anybody, did he?

56:07.239 --> 56:09.788
He needs me,
somebody he can depend on.

56:09.825 --> 56:10.951
Most drunks do.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.583
Oh, it's so easy for you. You come back
here after two and a half years.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.839
You don't know
what's going on in my life. You don't care.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.758
You just expect me to drop
everything and follow you!

56:18.792 --> 56:20.294
Wait a minute.

56:45.319 --> 56:47.162
Come with me, Jessie.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.751
By the time
he gets around to dying,

56:53.994 --> 56:56.417
there won't be
a dance left in you.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.276
Goodbye, Jamie.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.587
Endean?

58:26.670 --> 58:28.923
It's a bad time for me, Jamie.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.843
My sister and her husband,
their marriage busted up,

58:32.926 --> 58:35.270
so she and the kids
moved in with me.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.722
You know,
she don't work.

58:36.763 --> 58:39.767
- Leave her some money.
-It's not the point, the money.

58:39.808 --> 58:41.526
She don't do well
on her own.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.524
This is getting
nowhere.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.030
No?

58:53.113 --> 58:54.160
No.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.670
I'll miss you.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.675
- You make the next one, okay?
- You bet your ass.

59:08.754 --> 59:11.633
I've just got to get her
and the kids off my back.

59:22.768 --> 59:27.194
Terry, Sturgis wants
to know if his car will be ready by 5:00.

59:33.528 --> 59:34.575
No.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.994
Forget it. Get Derek.
Where is he?

59:37.032 --> 59:38.033
I got
his number.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.208
And Michel,
you call Paris,

59:39.284 --> 59:42.083
tell them both to meet us
at the Great Eastern Hotel Tuesday.

59:42.162 --> 59:44.585
Do you believe
that shit Terry gave you about his sister?

59:44.664 --> 59:46.257
What do you care?
It's his story.

59:46.333 --> 59:48.210
That candy ass
is scared of getting greased.

59:48.293 --> 59:50.796
I got a better story
with Miranda being pregnant.

59:50.837 --> 59:52.885
You want to
stay home, too?

59:53.590 --> 59:54.842
No.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.982
Watching her get fat
is going to be nauseating.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.367
I wouldn't waste
any time getting our money in the bank.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:16.447
Putting it all together in 40, 41 days is going
to be tough enough as it is.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:20.034
Right. Don't forget
the insurance.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.380
It's $100,000.
Each of us, yes.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:29.126
Over here, it's Mrs...
You got a pencil?

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.303
Drew Blakeley.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.756
L-E-Y.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:39.182
552 East 74.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:48.062
I'll give you the name of the
European beneficiaries later.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.067
For me?

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.192
Hey, you, what's your name?

01:00:57.195 --> 01:01:00.745
Express leaving
platform 13

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:03.581
will stop at Rugby,

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:06.997
Leicester, Loughborough,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.799
Nottingham, and Sheffield.

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:19.013
Jamie, Michel's here.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.866
Don't go by this.
Takes longer to go from here.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.784
That'll give you a better idea
of what I'm talking about.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.612
These are good.
You didn't take them.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.451
No.
They were a gift.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.785
- Michel, want a beer?
- Yeah.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.120
- Derek?
- Yeah.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.536
What is this,
coffee or tea? It's terrible.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.620
He always home?

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.210
He will be. Zangaro
has independence day coming up.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.337
- He'll be there for a while.
- How long have we got to hold it?

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:55.341
As long as it takes
to ﬂy the new president in from the border.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.305
Who is it
going to be?

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.340
Nixon.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.225
That's not funny,
Drew.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.019
Come on, Jamie,
punch up your grief and try a few jokes.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.220
Anyway, I spoke to Jinja.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:07.183
He's going to pick up and train as
many Zangarian exiles as he can.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:09.063
Oh, they won't be
worth a shit.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.985
Listen, Jinja's okay.
They'll be ready.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.108
They'll fight.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.818
What do we do with Kimba?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:18.243
Just give him over to the new
government. He gets loose, forget it.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.908
I'm hungry.
Anybody want a pizza?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:25.117
- No, I'll have a cheese roll.
- I'd like a treacle pudding.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:28.833
- A what?
- Yeah, you know, with a lot of sour sauce.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.497
Come on, Michel,
split a pepperoni with me.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.049
Anybody want to know
how we're going to do this?

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:59.200
There's no way
we'll do it without him sticking us up.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.825
That's the way it's gotta be.
He's the best.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.785
There's no delis in London.
I walked 15 blocks.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.538
What do you want,
room service? Okay. Who's got the bullets?

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:08.747
Hackett, in London.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.545
I thought of him.
ls he still in business?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.712
Far as I know.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.086
Tough part's
gonna be the freighter.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:15.917
It's got to be clean,
registered.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:18.845
Jamie, it's not going to be
a bargain basement. We've only got 4O days.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.221
Thirty-eight.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:24.097
Three-five launchers,
detonators, grenades. Baker still in Paris?

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:25.848
He was in Malaga.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:29.230
He sold some
shitty rifles to a bunch of Croatians.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.187
They cut a piece of
his stomach out.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.192
Ought to be a
real honest man these days.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.103
9mm quad.

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.733
Baker as well.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.775
Yeah, he's got
good contacts in Yugoslavia.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.235
Who fixes
the end users?

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:44.075
I see Benny Lambert
in Paris tomorrow.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.248
Okay, okay.
What's it gonna be?

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:50.248
M-16s, Armalites,
Uzis, AK-47s?

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.872
You want I should
call Boucher?

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.921
Maybe we should
let Derek call him.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.877
I cut his fucking
throat once.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.600
We all clear on what
we've got to get done?

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.350
Leave messages for me here
if you have to.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:14.439
Give me names, dates.
I'll see to it the money gets paid.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.441
And run hard deals.
These guys put up a million dollars.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:21.074
Let's make sure
there's change. I figure we ought to keep it.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.484
Certainly.

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:26.988
Everybody
goes home.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:28.957
Seconded.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.789
Vive la mort. Vive la guerre.
Vive Ie sacré mercenaire!

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.055
Of course, I can get you
an end users certificate, mon vieux.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.566
My contact will return from Belgrade at
the beginning of next week.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:55.813
How much?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:56.893
Fifteen thousand.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.774
Pounds? Francs?
Dollars? What?

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.313
Pounds.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.489
Francs.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:02.695
Dollars.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.530
$10,000.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:06.824
Done.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:16.163
Benny, we're in
a hurry. Eat later.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:01.355
I honestly don't know
what I can get.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:05.280
The demand for munitions
is staggering right now.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.532
There could be delays.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.075
We are short on time.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:11.736
We are short
on merchandise.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:17.250
9mm quad.
Three weeks delivery in Valencia.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:21.420
And?

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.419
That's all I need from you.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.548
$1,500 a thousand rounds,

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.256
20% surcharge
for an end user.

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.435
You can do better than that.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.563
10% for export license,
customs clearance.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.567
If you're trying to stick us,

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:45.020
I can do business
down the street.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:55.823
Au revoir.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.133
Shall we try again?

01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:41.076
Okay,
do it that way then,

01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:43.537
but I have to be sure the money will
be in his account by tomorrow.

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:44.921
I assure you
it will be.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.375
I'll have several more transactions for
you over the next couple of weeks.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.417
Be our pleasure.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.968
Thank you, Nigel.

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.046
Good afternoon, sir.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:01.062
Hey, Keith.
Keith Brown.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.854
Message for Mr. Brown
from General Kimba.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.565
I'll be damned.
How are you?

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:12.403
I'm fair to lousy.
You seem to have improved considerably.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.239
- I'm okay.
- Hey, good.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.907
Was the film
any use to you?

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:23.993
- Yeah.
-Good. Good.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.038
Glad to be of help.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.419
I don't suppose
you'd have...

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:34.633
Can I buy you
a drink?

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.597
What a good idea.
I thought you'd never ask.

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:37.632
You got it.

01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:40.010
So, what's
your name, Mr. Brown?

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:42.266
Shannon, James.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.768
That's an improvement
on the other one.

01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:46.934
What are you doing
in London?

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:50.104
I've got to see some people.
What's the message?

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:51.529
Message?

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.947
Kimba.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.571
"Come back,
all is forgiven."

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:57.531
Did you get
to see him?

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.612
After your ruckus
with the soldiers,

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:03.033
one of their lot
washed up in the canal with a broken neck.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.493
You wouldn't know
anything about that, I suppose?

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:05.622
No.

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.757
All right. Kimba's
paranoia took a jump after that.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.792
He wouldn't see anyone,
including me.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.633
There were nine
executions the next day.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.218
Four of them were women.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:19.970
But of course, I didn't
get that piece, either.

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.305
I was being escorted
to the airport at the time.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:25.142
I got thrown out of the country,
thank you very much.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.975
Dexter's daughter okay?

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:30.143
Funny you should mention her.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.479
The day I was leaving,
she actually talked to me.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.820
She asked about you.
Well, what I knew about you.

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.902
Pathetically little,
I had to confess.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:42.038
Did you get your film
on the air?

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.831
Yeah, last week.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.659
How'd you make out?

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:51.165
Behind these very walls,
just a few feet from me,

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:55.676
maybe even less,
resides Africa's most brutal dictator.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.347
It is rumored, though there
are conflicting reports,

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:03.802
but high ranking sources who
have asked not to be named,

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.390
say, "Who knows?"

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:10.562
Five million viewers
switched over to the Miss World contest.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.188
That's too bad.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:15.022
Yeah.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:18.900
When are you going back?

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:21.281
You gonna ask a lot of
questions I can't answer?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.534
Look, Shannon, I stuck out my
neck for you, for Christ's sake.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.036
You owe me
a little more than a drink.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:27.290
You ought
to watch your step.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.039
What I do is none
of your business, okay?

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.874
That's a matter of opinion.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.879
Is there a number
I can reach you?

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.797
You're going to
get in trouble.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.726
I'm not going
to be in town long.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.761
Fancy that.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.895
- Was good to see you.
- Likewise.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.130
Merde!

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:06.590
Can I
suggest something?

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.851
- Fire away.
- Which shells do you use?

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:11.145
That's very good.

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:15.433
Oh, you put the right mix in this thing and
its killing potential is fantastic.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:17.977
Your operation is
an assault, I suspect.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.779
Well, the XM-18
is effective up to 400 meters.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:24.325
If you load it in a well thought
out sequence, it's devastating.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.495
For instance,
first you use two rounds flares,

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.119
then a couple of gas,
then you improvise with the rest.

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:33.160
Fragmentation,
grenades,

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.542
tactical, anti-tank,
antipersonnel.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.170
It's what we in the business
call a mixed-fruit pudding.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.500
What do you say
is the rate of fire?

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.426
Eighteen rounds
in five seconds.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.629
It's the ultimate
in killing technology.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.014
It's light, accurate
and mobile.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.222
You ever been in combat
yourself, Baker?

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:51.848
I'm a Canadian.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:57.271
Twelve, 18, 26 for the Uzis
and the XM-18s.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.193
- You got a ship?
- Not yet.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.024
I'll get the name
to you when I do.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:05.033
Fine. Total, including
my percentage, $31,500.

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:06.951
Let's make it 32.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.954
$31,500.
Here's 15.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:13.374
You'll get another ten
when I see the stuff crated and ready to go.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:19.038
The balance
when the ship sails.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:38.392
It's not a question of where
she's been, mister. She's a great ship.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.476
Haifa, Gibraltar,

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.901
Tangiers, Dakar,
Monrovia, you name it.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.947
- Single hold?
- Aye, twin hatches.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:50.119
We need you
and your crew.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:52.238
My crew's kind of
choosy, mister.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:57.206
Double for your crew
and $10,000 for yourself.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.376
I'll need to
talk to them.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.883
We haven't got time
for a ballot.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.385
I count
the votes, mister.

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.217
What is your cargo?

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.931
It's not peanuts
from Monrovia.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.884
Well, peanuts
is rats, mister.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.683
Every kind of cargo's
got its own kind of trouble.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:19.640
Now what is your cargo?

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.601
Just trouble.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:32.612
The ship heads
for Toulon tonight.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.907
I'll call Michel,
tell him to get on the road.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:38.121
Oh, yeah,
Hackett's hardware's in Valencia.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:39.206
Good.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.787
I've got to get
something to eat.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.497
I've got a meeting.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:46.251
Endean's going to
introduce me to Zangaro's next president.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.508
Whoop-de-doo.
Pack your White House manners.

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:51.589
Do me a favor,
there's a guy named North.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.474
He's been following me.
He's okay, but he's a reporter.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.556
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yes, don't hurt him.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.263
For Christ's sake,
don't kill him, but discourage him.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:02.559
If he finds out what we're up to,
he'll have it on the 6:00 news.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:04.291
Hello, I'm with the
Boy Scouts of America.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.881
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Right.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.923
Look out!

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:14.843
Go on, jump the wall!

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.636
Jump! You idiot!

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:32.732
Come on, Ace, move!
You're going with me. Move it!

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.451
Hey, taxi!

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.616
Come on!
This man needs a doctor!

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:52.506
You know, when Zangaro
was fighting for independence,

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:56.051
he was as much of
a national hero as Kimba.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:59.763
We fought in the
bush together.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.093
Brothers.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.930
Then when he
makes himself president,

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:07.396
his first official
business was to put a price on my head.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.903
When he left the country,
some of his soldiers went with him.

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:13.405
We've been
together a long time now.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.691
Excellent fighters.

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:18.111
Very loyal.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:21.531
I have selected
the best of them for you.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:24.333
There will be 24
waiting in Freetown.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:27.582
They're very good.
They will die for Zangaro.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.418
It'll be more help to me
if they fight.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:33.426
If there is one who doesn't, I'll take his head
and mount it on the palace gates.

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:38.802
You and your brother both have the
same easy way of doing business.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.431
Olu Kimba
did not do business.

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:48.357
So now, Sekou Bobi
will be President.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:52.441
He wants to be God.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.948
I want to be rich.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:03.657
Shannon, why don't you
brief us on your strike plan?

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.783
You coming along?

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.412
There's nothing
you need to know about.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:13.170
The colonel's due
at the garrison at 0500 hours on the 25th.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.917
That's 5.00 a.m.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.378
if you're a minute late,
I'll give the whole thing back to Kimba.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.013
You're working
for me, Shannon.

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:21.515
You could fire me.

01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:24.392
If anything comes up,
I'll be in touch.

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.395
Mr. Shannon,
when I am president,

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:35.355
it would be
to your advantage to be my friend.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:41.368
Mr. Endean here
could tell you what a generous friend I am.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.409
I've got all the friends
I can handle right now.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:48.368
And forget about
your soldiers, okay? I've got my own.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.837
Just don't be late.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.878
Don't worry,
he's expendable.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.722
- To the hotel.
- Sir.

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:05.888
I wanted to waste the bastard, but
I figured you had to talk to him.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:09.137
Just so we understand
each other, you're dead.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:11.310
Give me straight answers
and I'll keep it painless.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.345
Go fuck yourself.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.778
Oh, no! No!

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.658
No!

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:33.373
Who's paying you?

01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:35.041
I said, who's paying you?

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.461
Same as pays you.

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.964
What'd he have
you doing?

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.462
Keeping track
of your whole operation.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:45.419
Did he tell you to kill North?

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:48.631
He was
a journalist.

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.387
He'd have
blown it for you.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:52.426
Did Endean tell you
to kill him?

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.144
I make
my own decisions.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:12.200
So the bloody fool said, "Don't bother to
wrap it, I'll eat it on the way home."

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.919
The measure of a man
is in his appetites.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.914
The more you consume,
the more you are.

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:24.504
Tell me,
do you measure ladies in the same way?

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.587
No. Ladies are not measured.
They are judged.

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:28.720
Oh, very good.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:34.510
Maybe one of you ladies would like to come
to my palace in Zangaro, huh?

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.345
How many bedrooms
do you have?

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.772
Caroline and I have thought
we'd like to visit your country, haven't we?

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:41.309
I'll get it downstairs.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:43.143
Maybe you both
can come, hmm?

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:46.527
With your appetites,
you'd need us both.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.916
Hello.
Yes, good evening, sir.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.703
It's a very bad connection.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:05.128
He's already signed
all the agreements.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:12.594
All the papers will be dated
once he's in power.

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.597
MAN ON PHONE". Hello,
can you hear me?

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.442
What?

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:30.408
Manson Industries will have
the exclusive mineral and mining rights

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.075
for all Zangaro.

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:37.114
No.

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:40.618
No, he's no idea
what's at stake.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.005
I promise.

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:49.297
I don't believe he can
even spell "platinum."

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.347
Things are going
very well, sir.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:04.186
Valencia.
On the 18th...

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:07.148
Subject to technical difficulties.
It can happen.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.858
But you got
to be there.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:21.166
- Want a drink?
- No.

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.661
You don't need to
worry about me, mister.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.548
But I do.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:00.951
Look, Shannon,

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.368
if something goes wrong,

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.461
I lose my license.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.878
I don't care about
any of this.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:14.086
I want that stuff
on board

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.217
tomorrow.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.311
What is it?

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.064
It hasn't left Madrid yet.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.350
We made a deal.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.769
It's too risky now.

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:35.278
If they check your
end user certificate, you're finished.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.987
Cancel the order.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:42.493
You want to give me
my money back?

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.580
Make the call.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:21.903
Brown.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:24.285
Sir, that's one
of my seamen.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.494
Want to see
your papers.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:31.581
Why do you need
eight men in such a small ship?

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:41.965
Seamen's card?

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.681
I left it with
my buddy's gear aboard ship.

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:47.346
He's an employee
of the company, right?

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:51.730
Missed his ship in Brindisi. He's coming
with us to Malta and going on to Telakia.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:53.685
Right.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:40.357
That last port.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:43.117
Last place anybody
will check the hold.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.907
You did good back there.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.485
Whose war are you
gonna fight?

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.395
Out!

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.328
Squad, attention!

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.701
Do you think
these geezers can fight?

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.034
Now, come on,
straighten up there!

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:56.873
Strictly bush league.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:01.210
I bet they've never seen
anything newer than bolt action Enfields.

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:04.634
Well, I hope they
don't blow the bottom out of this tub

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.052
when you give
them the Uzis.

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:16.138
Reporting, Captain.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:18.890
Let's go!

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:40.412
All right.
Attention.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:43.248
We'll fire a few rounds,
show you how they pull.

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:45.792
Now, they tend
to pull up and to the right.

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:47.092
I'll give you
an example.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.340
Squad!

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:54.593
Ready!

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:00.557
Fire!

01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:11.072
Squad, attention!

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:15.030
Stand easy.

01:32:20.285 --> 01:32:21.457
Cuban.

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:33.427
We'll be on
the beach at 0400.

01:32:33.465 --> 01:32:36.014
Sentries are spotted for you,
so just be quick.

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:39.479
Once the firefight starts,
we got only 15 minutes.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:43.145
If it goes over that,
I don't want to even think about it.

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:44.813
How long to the bridge?

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:46.770
About ten minutes.

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.655
If none of you have worked
with hired soldiers before, it's like this,

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:51.904
we handle tactics, that's all.

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:53.735
We give you support fire,
bring up the rear on an assault,

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:56.071
but it's your fight.
You got to do it.

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.328
You gotta be alive
to get paid.

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.119
- Everybody understand?
- Yeah.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.833
Kimba!

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:04.996
Kick his ass!

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:11.845
Hold. Here.
North of the border for two hours.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.672
Then you start southeast
toward the coast.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:15.807
I want you to
end up there at 0330.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.013
- No patrol boats?
- No. I said that.

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.429
After you drop us,
stay there till we get back.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:23.766
If they start tearing us up,
it's the only place we've got to run to.

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.020
I'll be there.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.853
If you're not,
hope to hell I got killed.

01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:29.146
Send it.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:55.843
- Right on schedule.
- Let's go to work.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.027
Let's go.

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:21.073
Move it.
Pick it up.

01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:16.177
You didn't tell them
we were coming?

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:17.807
Derek,
get over there.

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.139
Close it.

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:42.808
One CQ.

01:43:43.968 --> 01:43:44.969
Two CQ.

01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:46.308
Three CQ.

01:43:46.595 --> 01:43:47.596
Four CQ.

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:51.077
Squad!

01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:20.735
Jamie.

01:45:34.703 --> 01:45:36.546
Get! Get! Get!

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:32.322
What the hell happened
to support fire and bringing up the rear?

01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:44.709
Ready? Come on!

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:38.447
The Ministry of Works is going to have
to start clearing up tomorrow.

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:40.118
Shannon's got him
in the main building.

01:51:40.152 --> 01:51:41.153
There.

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:26.331
You're late!

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:30.002
What the hell's going on here? Who's that?

01:52:31.328 --> 01:52:32.750
Colonel Bobi.

01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:35.420
You are under arrest.

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.127
President Okoye.

01:52:46.176 --> 01:52:47.678
I am President.

01:52:47.719 --> 01:52:49.437
You're nobody.

01:52:49.513 --> 01:52:51.732
Shannon, get him
out of here.

01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:54.401
This whole country's
bought and paid for.

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:57.025
You're going to have
to buy it all over again.

01:54:15.057 --> 01:54:17.936
These, in the day
when heaven was falling

01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:24.825
The hour when
earth's foundations fled

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:32.412
Followed their
mercenary calling

01:54:34.117 --> 01:54:38.623
And took their wages
and are dead

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:46.047
And took their wages
and are dead

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:52.974
Their shoulders
held the sky suspended

01:54:54.471 --> 01:54:59.853
They stood
and earth's foundation stayed

01:55:00.602 --> 01:55:05.483
What God abandoned
these defended

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.656
And saved
the sum of things for pay

01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:57.887
These, in the day
when heaven was falling

01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:04.436
The hour that
earth's foundation fled

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:12.113
Followed their
mercenary calling

01:57:14.444 --> 01:57:19.371
And took their wages
and are dead

01:57:21.826 --> 01:57:26.457
And took their wages
and are dead
